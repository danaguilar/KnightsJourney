# KnightsJourney
These are the solutions for the two problems posed for The Odin Project section fo Data Structures found here: http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/data-structures-and-algorithms?ref=lc-pb

BinaryTree.rb creates contains a binary tree builder and shows some examples of breadth-first and depth-first searching

KnightsJourney uses a tree structure with breadth-first searching to find the fewest number of jumps a knight must take to get from one point on a chess board to another
